# COMP-3211-poker-induction
Solving a kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/poker-rule-induction as a course project

Project is being attempted with Python.

Edit the trainer.py at your own discretion, try out some stuff.

To run the trainer which also predicts the results do:
```
python trainer.py
```

The current trainer code has samples that I'm testing with logistic regression and Multi Layer Perceptrons.

You can also create other stuff to test.

Added .csv to ignore, download the datasets yourself to keep the repo from getting bloated
